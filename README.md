# Air-Pollution-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In this project, I explored publicly available air quality and water pollution datasets from Kaggle. These datasets have essential features such as air quality, water pollution, city, and country. Analysing these features will uncover patterns and trends in the dataset, and we can identify countries with the highest water pollution and air quality.
